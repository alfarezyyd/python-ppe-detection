- **Reduce the risk of workplace accidents** caused by negligence in using PPE.
- **Promote a more disciplined and safety-conscious work culture.**
- **Provide accurate and real-time data** as a foundation for better decision-making.
- **Contribute to the improvement of workplace safety standards**, especially in high-risk industrial sectors.

The purpose of this project is to make technology a tool for **protection, not merely convenience**.
